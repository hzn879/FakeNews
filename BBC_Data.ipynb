    "5. Discussion. Including the newly scraped data in the dataset is not straightforward because there are no labels. Without knowing whether the articles are \"fake\" or \"reliable,\" the data cannot be directly used for supervised learning. However, if labeled properly, it could enhance the dataset by increasing its size and diversity, potentially improving model generalization. The risk is that the new data might introduce bias or imbalance if it does not match the original distribution. A statistical comparison of word frequency, article length, and source credibility between the original and scraped datasets could help determine compatibility. If the differences are minimal, incorporating the new dataâafter labelingâcould be beneficial. There is also an option to consider those news coming from BBC as reliable, then it could help with balancing the dataset."
